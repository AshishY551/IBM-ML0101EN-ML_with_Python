ðŸ§ª Add Evaluation Approach 1: Train-Test on Same Dataset (Module 2.9)

- Updated `Module2.9.txt` with detailed explanation of the first model evaluation strategy:
  â€¢ Approach 1 â€” Train and Test on the SAME dataset
    - Train the model using the full dataset.
    - Select a portion of the dataset (e.g., rows 6â€“9) as the test set (with labels hidden during prediction).
    - Use the trained model to predict the target values for this test set.
    - Compare predicted values (Å·) with actual values (y) to assess accuracy.

- Key Concepts Added:
  â€¢ Test set vs Actual values (ground truth).
  â€¢ Basic error calculation: average difference between predicted and actual values.
  â€¢ Importance of evaluation metrics â€” based on similarity between Å· and y.
  â€¢ Simplest evaluation scenario explained step by step.

âœ¨ This commit introduces the foundation of model evaluation by demonstrating how to validate regression accuracy using a portion of the dataset itself.
