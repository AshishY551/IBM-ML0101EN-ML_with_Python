feat(ml-basics): Add detailed explanation of Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning with examples

- Introduced Supervised Learning:
  - Explained concept: "We teach the model" using labeled datasets
  - Showed cancer dataset example with attributes, features, observations
  - Clarified data types: numerical vs categorical
  - Covered two main techniques:
    - Classification → predicting discrete categories
    - Regression → predicting continuous values
  - Provided regression example using automobile dataset (Engine size, Cylinders, Fuel Consumption → CO2 emissions)

- Introduced Unsupervised Learning:
  - Defined as training on unlabeled data without direct supervision
  - Highlighted common techniques:
    - Clustering (grouping similar data points)
    - Dimensionality Reduction / Feature Selection
    - Density Estimation (finding structure in data)
    - Market Basket Analysis (associative rules for itemsets)
  - Discussed real-world applications: customer segmentation, anomaly detection, music grouping

- Compared Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning:
  - Supervised → labeled data, classification & regression
  - Unsupervised → unlabeled data, clustering & exploratory methods
  - Highlighted differences in evaluation methods, control, and complexity

Why:
This commit expands the ML fundamentals module by adding a structured and practical explanation of supervised vs unsupervised learning, with dataset-based examples, techniques, and real-world applications—providing learners with a strong conceptual foundation before diving into algorithms.
