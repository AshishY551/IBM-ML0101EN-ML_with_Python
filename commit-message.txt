📈 Add introduction to Non-Linear Regression (Module2.10)

- Added **2.10.1-Non_linear_regression.jpg** for visual reference of GDP vs Time dataset.  
- Created **Module2.10.txt** covering:  
  🔹 Context: China’s GDP growth over time with curvilinear trend.  
  🔹 Key Questions:  
      • Can GDP be predicted based on time?  
      • Is linear regression sufficient for this dataset?  
  🔹 Insight: Linear regression fails for non-linear patterns (GDP shows exponential/logistic growth).  
  🔹 Explanation: Non-linear regression is required as growth accelerates after 2005 and decelerates in 2010s.  
  🔹 Example model: Exponential form  
      ŷ = θ₀ + θ₁ (θ₂ˣ),  
      where θ parameters are estimated for prediction.  

- ✅ Sets the foundation for applying non-linear regression methods.  
- 📘 Marks the transition from linear regression limitations to more complex model fitting.
