ðŸ“Š Add Multiple Regression Model & Prediction (Module 2.8)

- Updated `Module2.8.txt` with new sections and outputs:
  â€¢ 2.1 - Multiple Regression Model
    - Introduced the concept of multiple independent variables influencing CO2 emissions.
    - Implemented `LinearRegression()` using sklearn with features [ENGINESIZE, CYLINDERS, FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB].
    - Printed model coefficients â†’ [[11.47039379  7.17702012  9.43978525]].
    - Explained Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) as the underlying method, including:
      â–¸ Minimizing squared errors (SSE/MSE).
      â–¸ Closed-form analytical solution.
      â–¸ Optimization algorithms (Gradient Descent, SGD, Newtonâ€™s Method).

  â€¢ 2.2 - Prediction
    - Performed predictions using the test dataset with the trained multiple regression model.
    - Calculated evaluation metrics:
      â–¸ Mean Squared Error (MSE): 590.67
      â–¸ Variance score (RÂ²): 0.86
    - Added detailed explanation of Explained Variance regression score, formula, and interpretation.

- Added supporting lab resources:

  â€¢ 8.3-practice.jpg
  â€¢ 8.4-Prediction.jpg
  â€¢ ML0101EN-Reg-Multiple-Linear-Regression-Co2.ipynb

âœ¨ This commit completes the Multiple Regression section with both theoretical foundations (OLS) and hands-on implementation, enabling training, testing, and evaluation of multi-variable linear models.
