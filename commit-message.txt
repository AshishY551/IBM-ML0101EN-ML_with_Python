🧮 Added Polynomial Regression Lab (Module2.11)

📘 Module: 2.11 - Polynomial Regression

🎯 Objectives:
- Learn how to implement Polynomial Regression using Scikit-Learn.
- Create, train, test, and apply a regression model on real-world data.

🧰 Sections & Key Additions:
-------------------------------------------------
1️⃣ Importing Libraries  
- Added essential Python packages: matplotlib, pandas, pylab, numpy.  
- Enabled inline visualization with %matplotlib inline.  

2️⃣ Downloading Dataset  
- Used wget to fetch ‘FuelConsumption.csv’ from IBM Cloud.  
  → Dataset: Canadian light-duty vehicle fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions.  

3️⃣ Data Overview  
- Described dataset fields: MODELYEAR, MAKE, MODEL, ENGINESIZE, CYLINDERS, TRANSMISSION, etc.  
- Emphasized the `CO2EMISSIONS` target variable.  
- Displayed sample output (df.head()).  

4️⃣ Feature Selection  
- Selected features for regression:  
  `ENGINESIZE`, `CYLINDERS`, `FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB`, and `CO2EMISSIONS`.  
- Showed first 9 rows of the compact dataset.

5️⃣ Data Visualization  
- Added scatter plot: CO₂ Emissions vs Engine Size using Matplotlib.  
  → Visual trend shows a curvilinear relationship ideal for polynomial regression.  

6️⃣ Train-Test Split  
- Randomly divided dataset: 80% for training, 20% for testing.  
  → Introduced the concept of mutually exclusive datasets for model validation.  

7️⃣ Polynomial Regression Concept  
- Explained that when data trends are **non-linear or curved**, Polynomial Regression is more effective.  
- Defined the second-degree model:
  
    𝑦 = β₀ + β₁x + β₂x²  

- Introduced `PolynomialFeatures()` from scikit-learn to automatically create new features:
  → 1, x, x², …, xⁿ for the chosen polynomial degree.  
- Clarified that polynomial regression is a special case of multiple linear regression.

-------------------------------------------------
🧩 Outcome:
Learners will understand:
- How to preprocess and visualize real-world emission data.  
- How to model curvilinear relationships using polynomial terms.  
- The difference between linear and polynomial regression fits.  

✅ Ready for next section (Module2.12): Evaluating Polynomial Regression Models 
(e.g., plotting predictions, calculating R², MAE, and visual comparison).
