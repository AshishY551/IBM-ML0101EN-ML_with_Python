chore(module1): Complete graded review questions and finalize Module 1

- Successfully answered graded review questions:
  1. Confirmed ML definition → algorithms that learn from data without explicit programming
  2. Identified two supervised learning techniques → Classification and Regression
  3. Described scikit-learn → collection of algorithms and tools for machine learning

- Scored 100% (1/1 on each question) with full correctness
- Marked completion of all quizzes and exercises for Module 1
- Module 1 now fully covered:
  - Python ML libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-learn)
  - Scikit-learn usage and functions
  - Supervised vs Unsupervised learning (concepts, techniques, examples)
  - Graded Review Questions ✅

Why:
This commit documents the successful completion of Module 1 including both conceptual lessons and graded assessments, establishing a solid foundation before progressing to advanced ML modules.
