📊 Expand Non-Linear Regression module with theory and visuals (Module2.10)

- 🖼️ Added visual illustrations:
  • 2.10.2-Types_of_multilinear_regression.jpg — shows different multi-linear regression structures.  
  • 2.10.3-Non_linear_regression.jpg — depicts examples of curvilinear relationships.  
  • 2.10.4-Polynomial_regression.jpg — visualizes quadratic and cubic fits for complex trends.  

- 🧠 Updated Module2.10.txt with deeper theoretical explanations:
  🔹 Added discussion on **exponential model form**  
       → ŷ = θ₀ + θ₁ (θ₂ˣ), used for GDP trend prediction.  
  🔹 Introduced the concept of **polynomial regression**, describing quadratic, cubic, and higher-degree fits.  
       → Emphasized importance of selecting the best-fit regression type.  
  🔹 Defined **non-linear regression** clearly:  
       • Models non-linear relationship between dependent and independent variables.  
       • Non-linearity refers to parameters (θ), not necessarily to features (x).  
  🔹 Explained that **least squares** cannot directly estimate non-linear parameters.  
  🔹 Added guidance on identifying when a problem is linear vs. non-linear:  
       • Visual inspection of scatterplots.  
       • Correlation coefficient check (≥ 0.7 indicates linear tendency).  
  🔹 Concluded with modeling advice:  
       • Use polynomial regression, non-linear models, or data transformation for non-linear trends.  

- ✅ Module2.10 now provides a complete theoretical foundation connecting:
  Linear → Multi-linear → Non-linear → Polynomial regression frameworks.

- 📘 Sets up next section (Module2.11) for practical demonstration of **curve fitting & polynomial regression modeling**.
