📈 Enhanced Polynomial Regression Lab (Module2.11)

🧮 Added practical model fitting, visualization, and evaluation steps.

🔹 Key Additions:
-------------------------------------------------
✅ Introduced the concept of Polynomial Regression:
   - Explained curvy trends and higher-degree polynomial modeling.
   - Provided mathematical form: y = β₀ + β₁x + β₂x².

✅ Demonstrated Polynomial Feature Generation:
   - Used scikit-learn's PolynomialFeatures() for degree=2 expansion.
   - Included transformation output example (x⁰, x¹, x² features).
   - Explained matrix visualization and relation to Multiple Linear Regression.

✅ Model Fitting:
   - Implemented using LinearRegression() from sklearn.
   - Displayed Coefficients & Intercept:
       → Coefficients: [[ 0.  51.21  -1.63 ]]
       → Intercept: [106.62]
   - Clarified that Polynomial Regression is a *special case* of Linear Regression.

✅ Visualization:
   - Plotted CO₂ Emissions vs Engine Size.
   - Added polynomial curve fitting (red line) over training data scatter.

✅ Model Evaluation:
   - Used r2_score and error metrics:
       • Mean Absolute Error: 22.60  
       • MSE: 880.25  
       • R² Score: 0.76
   - Highlighted interpretation of fit accuracy.

-------------------------------------------------
🎯 Outcome:
Learners now understand:
- How to construct, fit, and visualize polynomial regression models.
- How feature transformation works in scikit-learn.
- How to measure model accuracy using regression metrics.
