feat(supervised-learning): Add explanation of supervised ML with classification & regression examples

- Added content and visuals for supervised learning
  - Explained concept: "We teach the model" using labeled datasets
  - Highlighted importance of labeled data in training and prediction
  - Covered common data types used in ML: numeric and categorical
  - Provided supervised learning techniques overview:
    - Classification → predicting discrete categories
    - Regression → predicting continuous values

- Included practical examples:
  - Classification dataset for categorical prediction
  - Regression example using automobile dataset (Engine size, Cylinders, Fuel Consumption → CO2 emissions)

Why:
This commit introduces the fundamentals of supervised learning, clarifies the distinction between classification and regression, and provides real-world examples to connect theory with practice.
