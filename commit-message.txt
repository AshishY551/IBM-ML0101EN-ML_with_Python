ðŸ§ª Add Lab: Multiple Linear Regression (Module 2.8)

- Created folder 'Lab Multiple Linear Regression' with initial file `Module2.8.txt`  
- Added sections with detailed walkthrough and outputs:
  â€¢ 0.1 - Objectives of Multiple Linear Regression lab  
  â€¢ 0.2 - Table of Contents (#understanding-data, #reading_data, #multiple_regression_model, #prediction, #practice)  
  â€¢ 1.1 - Importing required packages (matplotlib, pandas, numpy, pylab)  
  â€¢ 1.2 - Downloading dataset using wget from IBM Object Storage (FuelConsumption.csv) with logs  
  â€¢ 1.3 - Understanding dataset fields (MODELYEAR, MAKE, MODEL, VEHICLE CLASS, ENGINE SIZE, CYLINDERS, TRANSMISSION, FUELTYPE, FUEL CONSUMPTION variants, CO2 EMISSIONS)  
  â€¢ 1.4 - Reading dataset into pandas DataFrame and displaying sample rows with df.head()  
  â€¢ 1.5 - Feature selection into cdf (Engine Size, Cylinders, Fuel Consumption metrics, CO2 Emissions)  

âœ¨ This commit establishes the foundational steps of the Multiple Linear Regression Lab:
   from setup, data download, feature exploration, to structured workflow.
