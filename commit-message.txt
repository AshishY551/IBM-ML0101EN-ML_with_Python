ðŸ“ˆ Update Module2.3: Optimized Parameters & MSE Explanation + New Illustrative Images

- Updated Module2.3.txt to include:
  â€¢ Detailed explanation of finding the best-fit hyper-plane in Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
  â€¢ Concept of optimized parameters: Î¸ vector values that minimize prediction errors
  â€¢ Step-by-step example demonstrating prediction error for a single row:
      - Predicted vs actual COâ‚‚ emission
      - Calculation of error (residual)
  â€¢ Introduction to Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a measure of overall model performance
  â€¢ Emphasis that the objective of MLR is to minimize MSE for all predictions
  â€¢ Leads into discussion: "How do we find the parameters or coefficients for MLR?"

- Added illustrative images:
  â€¢ 7.4-MSE To calculate model error.jpg â€“ visual explanation of MSE
  â€¢ 7.3-Predicting value with Multiple linear regression.jpg â€“ updated to align with MSE example
