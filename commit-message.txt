ðŸ“Š Add Linear Regression Introduction & Topology (Module 2.6)

- Added high-level introduction to Linear Regression:
  â€¢ Beginner-friendly, no prior linear algebra required
  â€¢ Explained dataset (Engine Size, Cylinders, Fuel Consumption, COâ‚‚ Emissions)
  â€¢ Motivated regression by predicting COâ‚‚ emissions from Engine Size

- Covered Linear Regression fundamentals:
  â€¢ Defined independent (x) and dependent (y) variables
  â€¢ Highlighted requirement: dependent variable must be continuous
  â€¢ Clarified independent variables can be categorical or continuous

- Introduced types of Linear Regression:
  â€¢ Simple Linear Regression (1 independent variable â†’ y)
  â€¢ Multiple Linear Regression (Engine Size + Cylinders â†’ y)

- Explained regression line & formula:
  â€¢ yÌ‚ = Î¸0 + Î¸1x1 for simple linear regression
  â€¢ Î¸0 â†’ intercept, Î¸1 â†’ slope/gradient (coefficients)
  â€¢ Scatterplots to visualize linear relation between x & y

- Discussed model fitting:
  â€¢ Error defined as residual (distance from point to regression line)
  â€¢ Mean Squared Error (MSE) introduced as loss function
  â€¢ Objective: minimize MSE by finding optimal Î¸0, Î¸1

- Added context on prediction accuracy:
  â€¢ Example: predicted COâ‚‚ = 340 vs actual 250 â†’ 90-unit error
  â€¢ Residual errors show model fit quality

- Highlighted approaches to parameter estimation:
  â€¢ Mathematical solution (closed-form)
  â€¢ Optimization-based methods (iterative updates)

âœ… Makes regression approachable with dataset examples  
âœ… Explains both intuition & mathematical formulation  
âœ… Sets foundation for deeper dive into evaluation metrics & optimization
