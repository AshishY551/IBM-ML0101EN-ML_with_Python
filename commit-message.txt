feat(ml-libraries): Add Python ML libraries overview and scikit-learn examples

- Added slide on Python libraries for machine learning:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - SciPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn
  - Python (core)

- Introduced scikit-learn overview:
  - Free software ML library
  - Supports classification, regression, clustering
  - Works with NumPy & SciPy
  - Great documentation and easy to implement
  - Covered workflow: Data preprocessing → Train/Test split → Algorithm setup → Model fitting → Prediction → Evaluation → Model export

- Added scikit-learn functions example:
  - Preprocessing with StandardScaler
  - Dataset splitting using train_test_split
  - Model training with SVM (SVC)
  - Predictions with .predict()
  - Evaluation using confusion matrix

- Included explanation on confusion matrix for model accuracy
