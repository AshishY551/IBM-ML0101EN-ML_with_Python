ðŸ“˜ Add Module 2 Lab: Simple Linear Regression instructions  

- Integrated detailed course lab description for Module 2 (Regression).  
- Added guidance on using CC Labs with Jupyter Notebook for hands-on practice.  
- Included troubleshooting steps with Support contact reference.  
- Provided external resources: IBM SPSS Modeler (Mac & Windows) with IBM Cloud setup link.  
- Added note on using IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) for scalable cloud-based notebooks.  
- Enhanced clarity and student experience with structured learning flow (Start Lab button, instructions, and external links).  

âœ¨ This commit improves learner accessibility by consolidating lab resources, ensuring smooth onboarding, and offering advanced exploration options.


ðŸ“Š Add Module 2.2 - Linear Regression Data Exploration & Visualization  

- Added Jupyter workflow screenshots:  
  â€¢ 1-Import package & dataset  
  â€¢ 2-Reading Data  
  â€¢ 3-Data exploration (summary statistics)  
  â€¢ 4-Feature selection  
  â€¢ 5.1-Plot & graphs (histograms)  
  â€¢ 5.2-Plot2 (scatter plot: FuelConsumption vs Emissions)  
  â€¢ 5.3-Plot3 (scatter plot: EngineSize vs Emissions)  
  â€¢ 6-Practice example  
  â€¢ JupyterNotebook_lab-linear regression  

- Added **Module2.2.txt** with structured steps:  
  â€¢ Package imports (matplotlib, pandas, numpy, pylab)  
  â€¢ Dataset download via wget â†’ FuelConsumption.csv  
  â€¢ Dataset schema & description (ModelYear, EngineSize, Cylinders, Fuel Consumption, COâ‚‚ emissions, etc.)  
  â€¢ Data loading & inspection (`df.head()`)  
  â€¢ Descriptive statistics summary (`df.describe()`)  
  â€¢ Feature selection â†’ cdf with [ENGINESIZE, CYLINDERS, FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB, CO2EMISSIONS]  
  â€¢ Visualization: Histograms + Scatter plots (FuelConsumption vs Emissions, EngineSize vs Emissions)  

âœ… Demonstrates data preprocessing, exploration & feature selection for regression  
âœ… Strengthens practical learning with visual correlations of variables  
âœ… Provides clean, reproducible pipeline for COâ‚‚ emissions dataset analysis.
