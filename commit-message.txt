ðŸ”º Extended Polynomial Regression with Degree-3 Model (Module2.11)

ðŸš€ Enhancement Summary:
-----------------------------------------
âœ… Added Polynomial Regression (degree=3) implementation:
   - Generated new feature set using PolynomialFeatures(degree=3)
   - Fitted model using sklearn LinearRegression()

âœ… Model Training:
   - train_x transformed â†’ train_x_poly3
   - Coefficients and Intercept printed for inspection:
       â†’ clf3.coef_, clf3.intercept_
   - Visualized cubic regression curve (red line) overlayed on training scatter plot.

âœ… Evaluation Metrics Added:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - RÂ² Score for performance comparison

ðŸ§  Purpose:
   - Demonstrates higher-degree polynomial curve fitting.
   - Allows learners to compare linear, quadratic, and cubic regression fits.
   - Highlights trade-offs in model complexity vs. accuracy.

ðŸ“Š Results:
   - Visual comparison of curvature improvements over quadratic fit.
   - Quantitative metrics indicate better fit (higher RÂ², lower MAE/MSE).

-----------------------------------------
ðŸŽ¯ Outcome:
Students now understand:
- How to build and visualize polynomial models of degree 3.
- How increasing polynomial degree affects model flexibility and performance.
- How to evaluate and compare regression models with consistent metrics.

ðŸ“ˆ Next step: Introduce overfitting concept and performance comparison table in Module2.12.
