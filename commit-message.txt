ðŸ“Š Add Regression Evaluation Metrics (Module2.9 + Diagram)

- Added **7.9-Error evaluation matrix in regression.jpg** (visual summary of metrics).  
- Created **Module2.9.txt** with detailed explanation of regression error metrics:

  ðŸ”¹ **Error Definition**
      â€¢ Difference between actual data points and model's predicted trend line.  
      â€¢ Error can be quantified in multiple ways depending on focus.  

  ðŸ”¹ **Key Metrics**
      â€¢ **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Simple average of absolute errors.  
      â€¢ **MSE (Mean Squared Error):** Squares errors to penalize large deviations more.  
      â€¢ **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Square root of MSE; interpretable in same units as target.  
      â€¢ **RAE (Relative Absolute Error):** Normalizes total absolute error using mean predictor.  
      â€¢ **RSE (Relative Squared Error):** Variant of RAE, widely used for calculating RÂ².  
      â€¢ **RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination):** Not error but measures how well regression line fits data.  

  ðŸ”¹ **Insights**
      â€¢ MAE is intuitive, but MSE/ RMSE highlight large errors.  
      â€¢ RMSE is preferred in practice due to interpretability in target units.  
      â€¢ RÂ² provides an overall model fit indicator.  
      â€¢ Choice of metric depends on model type, dataset characteristics, and domain.  

- âœ… Consolidates theoretical understanding + diagram for quick visual learning.  
- ðŸ“˜ Forms foundation for comparing model accuracy and guiding optimization in regression analysis.
