docs: add regression learning objectives and intro notes

- Added detailed learning objectives covering:
  • Regression Algorithms
  • Model Evaluation (Overfitting & Underfitting)
  • Understanding Evaluation Models
  • Simple Linear Regression

- Documented "Intro to Regression" with focus on:
  • Problem statement: predicting CO2 emissions using EngineSize & Cylinders
  • Definition: regression as prediction of continuous values
  • Clarification of variable types:
      - Dependent variable (y) as target/final goal
      - Independent variables (x) as explanatory factors
  • Regression model: relationship of y to function of x
  • Key point: dependent variable must be continuous, not discrete
  • Independent variables can be categorical or continuous

- Improved clarity, formatting, and professional tone for better readability.
