- Added new resources:  
  â€¢ 7.6-example-prediction-with-multiple-linear-regression.jpg  
  â€¢ 7.7-concerns-&-disadvantages-of-multiple-linear-regression.jpg  

- Updated module2.3.txt with:  
  â€¢ Example of prediction using multiple linear regression parameters (Î¸0, Î¸1, Î¸2, â€¦)  
    â–¸ Demonstrated calculation for COâ‚‚ emissions on a specific dataset row  
    â–¸ Highlighted feature importance (Cylinder vs EngineSize)  
  â€¢ Concerns & disadvantages of multiple linear regression  
    â–¸ Risk of overfitting with too many independent variables  
    â–¸ Guidelines for variable selection and theoretical justification  
    â–¸ Handling categorical variables with dummy encoding  
    â–¸ Importance of ensuring linear relationship between predictors and target  
    â–¸ Recommendation to switch to non-linear regression if linearity is absent  

âœ¨ This update adds applied prediction workflow and critical caveats, balancing practice with theoretical awareness.
