2.--Intro to Regression 

The question is, "Given this dataset, can we predict the Co2 emission of a car using
other fields, such as EngineSize or Cylinders?"

We can use regression methods to predict a continuous value, such as CO2 Emission, using
some other variables.

Regression::::

-"Indeed, regression is the process of predicting a continuous value.
In regression there are two types of variables: a dependent variable and one or more independent
variables."

The dependent variable can be seen as the "state", "target" or "final goal" we study
and try to predict, and the independent variables, also known as explanatory variables, can be
seen as the "causes" of those "states".
-
The independent variables are shown conventionally by x; and the dependent variable is notated
by y.
A regression model relates y, or the dependent variable, to a function of x, i.e., the independent
variables.
The key point in the regression is that our dependent value should be continuous, and
cannot be a discreet value.
However, the independent variable or variables can be measured on either a categorical or
continuous measurement scale.
