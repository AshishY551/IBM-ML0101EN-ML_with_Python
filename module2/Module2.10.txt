The first column, is the years, and the second, is China's corresponding annual gross domestic
income in US dollars for that year.
This is what the data points look like.
Now, we have a couple of interesting questions.
First, “Can GDP be predicted based on time?”
And second, “Can we use a simple linear regression to model it?”
Indeed, if the data shows a curvy trend, then linear regression will not produce very accurate
results when compared to a non-linear regression -- simply because, as the name implies, linear
regression presumes that the data is linear.
The scatterplot shows that there seems to be a strong relationship between GDP and time,
but the relationship is not linear.
As you can see, the growth starts off slowly, then from 2005 onward, the growth is very
significant.
And finally, it decelerates slightly in the 2010s.
It kind of looks like either a logistical or exponential function.
So, it requires a special estimation method of the non-linear regression procedure.

For example, if we assume that the model for these data points are exponential functions,
such as y ̂ = θ_0 + θ_1 〖θ_2〗^x, our job is to estimate the parameters of the model,
i.e. θs, and use the fitted model to predict GDP for unknown or future cases.
